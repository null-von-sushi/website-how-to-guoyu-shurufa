## Your options

### RIME?
On ChromeOS normal RIME is not available, however there is a [fork of it made for Fyde OS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/çœŸæ–‡éŸµè¾“å…¥æ³•/ppgpjbgimfloenilfemmcejiiokelkni) that we can use.

After installing this, you should be able to add FydeOS's RhythmIME to your active language list. 

Note that I take no responsibility for this extension. I didn't make it. 

#### Configuring
You select layout in the extension options.

Again, it's all in chinese.

Also, the list of layouts is very restrictive and limited. You can get around it though:

 - Download Luna Pinyin and whatever the Zhuyin option was called.
 - Edit the schema.yaml fileof luna Pinyin in order to make it Traditional, Traditional (ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ Standard), Terra Pinyin or Terra Pinyin with ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼-standard characters, or simplified.
