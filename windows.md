#### Installing RIME
[latest release on Github](https://github.com/rime/weasel/releases/latest)

The installer & options are unfortunately only in chinese at the time of this writing ([although that should change soon](https://github.com/rime/weasel/pull/900)). You can use google lens / google translate's camera feature for now. Once installed it has probably the best IME you can get.
