You'll probably be using Gboard already. If not, you should. There might eventually be a open source keyboard out there², but for now, this is one of the better ones.

There is also the suite of older legacy IMEs that Google deprecated. Despite no longer being in active development, they still work and can still be downloaded. For Chinese, one such keyboard is the "Google Zhuyin" keyboard.

My primary recommendation is GBoard, mostly because of a unique bug/feature, however some people prefer Google Zhuyin Input's automatic word suggestions. It also has the advantage of allowing you to very quickly switch between english & chinese, but within chinese also between pinyin, zhuyin, handwriting and cangjie. This can be very useful if you have native-speaker-friends who might not know pinyin/zhuyin, so you can quickly switch to handwriting mode and hand your phone to them when asking "what character is that". The disadvantages will be the lack of Material You theming, no custom dictionary entries and no 'pinyin bug' that Gboard has (described bellow).
Just install both, they're free and don't take much space, and have a play around with them. It's possible to use GBoard as your main keyboard, but then switch to Zhuyin Input temporarily if you need a function from it, or do it the other way around.

Regarding GBoard, the main reason you should use it is because it is one of the few keyboards that have proper traditional chinese punctuation marks, while also supporting basically any language you want. Also, it has a really really cool bug we can use if we're learning Mandarin: It can really quickly show you pinyin + tones for words you're typing!

For example, you're trying to type Bubble Tea, but you only vaguely remember the word. 
"Something with a Z ... then another Z? But I know the last two words are nai3 cha2!"
So you type zznaicha and tap the first suggestion: 珍珠奶茶. But how does that help you? Because you can tap and hold the suggestion to show the pinyin. If you set it up correctly, it will look like so:

In order to enable this, first go into the Gboard options, and add both the languages Chinese Traditional/Chinese Simplified (pick your preferred one), and Cantonese. Cantonese is it's own language, it's not shown under "Chinese". Once you added Cantonese, enable the "Romanisation" layout (it used to be called Jyutping, and might still be called that if you haven't updated the app), then enable the "show canonical romanisation" option.
Now go to any text window, and switch to Cantonese (粵語拼音). Type "o" and tap-and-hold the first suggestion: 我. If you tap and hold 我 it should show you ngo above the character now. Cool, now switch to your mandarin layout and try typing nihao. It should show you ni3 hao3. If it worked correctly, you can now go back into Gboard settings and remove the Cantonese layouts. The "show caninical romanisation" option seems to apply to Mandarin too, despite there not being a setting for it under the Chinese language option.


Note: RIME³ technically does exist for Android too, but the UI design is awful and it's a better experience to use GBoard I think. Feel free to try it though.
